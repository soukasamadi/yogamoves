# Credits

## Code

I used some Youtube videos to get the information to create some responsive section without Javascript
like the [navbar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLOT0APQzDs&t=739s) and [review-section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CZhGDU5cWM) but I modified them to look good with my website.
